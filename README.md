## Fast-ALPR: A High-Performance Automatic License Plate Recognition System (C++ Implementation)

This repository provides a robust and efficient implementation of an Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) system using C++. Leveraging the power of OpenCV for image processing and TensorFlow for deep learning, Fast-ALPR aims to achieve high accuracy and speed for license plate detection and recognition. 

### Features:

* **High Accuracy:**  Employs state-of-the-art deep learning models for precise license plate detection and character recognition.
* **Optimized Performance:**  Optimized for speed and efficiency, enabling real-time or near-real-time ALPR capabilities.
* **Flexible Design:**  Can be customized to adapt to various license plate formats and environments.
* **Scalable Architecture:**  Designed for scalability, allowing for processing of multiple images or video streams concurrently.
* **Cross-Platform Support:**  Built using CMake, enabling easy compilation and deployment on different operating systems.
